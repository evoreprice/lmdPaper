# Summary

# Significance statement

# Introduction

* Rice inflorescence development
+ branching & grain yield
+ sequential changes in meristem activity
+ few key genes

# Results

## Dissections in early stages of inflorescence development
+  **Figure**: laser microdissections

## Transcriptome sequencing of meristem samples
+ Max. 1 paragraph about boring sequencing stats
+ **Table** (or supplementary): # reads, mapping %, rRNA, introns, genes blah blah

## Clustering of expression patterns

To recover common expression patterns in the meristem samples, read counts were transformed using the variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) included in the `DESeq2` package [@Love:2014cf], and the standardised, VST-transformed read counts were clustered using the fuzzy *c*-means algorithm implemented in the `Mfuzz` package [@Futschik:2005vo]. To determine the optimum number of clusters (*c*), the minimum distance between cluster centroids of clusters produced with *c* values between `cmin` to `cmax`, 

+ **Figure**: Gene expression clusters
+ GO enrichment?
+ Clusters including 'known' genes

## Patterns of expression of transcription families
+ **Figure**: GSEA of transcription factor families

## MADS genes: comparison of expression & homology in rice, tomato, arabidopsis
+ **Figure**: Similarity tree of MADS proteins with expression values and dN/dS values for each one.

I think `inline code` should work?
